# V2 – User Login & JWT Token Generation

## Objective
V2 adds login functionality. After validating a user's credentials, the API generates a JSON Web Token (JWT). Token validation on incoming API requests is covered in V3.

## Authentication and password hashing
Authentication establishes who the user is. The user supplies an email and password; the backend verifies them against the registered account.

The database stores `PasswordHash`, not the original password. The password hasher verifies the supplied password against the stored hash.

The application registers the hasher:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IPasswordHasher<User>, PasswordHasher<User>>();
```

## Login flow

```text
Client sends email + password
          |
          v
       Login API
          |
          v
      UserService
          |
          | Find user by email
          | Verify password hash
          v
    Credentials valid?
       /       \
     No         Yes
     |           |
Authentication  JwtService
failure response   |
                   v
              Generate JWT
                   |
                   v
               Return token
```

## JWT structure
A JWT consists of three Base64URL-encoded sections:

```text
Header.Payload.Signature
```

- Header identifies the token type and signing algorithm.
- Payload contains claims about the authenticated user.
- Signature allows the API to verify that the token has not been modified and was signed using the expected key.

A signed JWT is not automatically encrypted. Do not place passwords or secrets in its payload.

## Claims used by this project

| Claim | Value |
|---|---|
| NameIdentifier | UserId |
| Name | FullName |
| Email | Email |
| Role | User role |

```csharp
var claims = new[]
{
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.UserId.ToString()),
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, user.FullName),
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, user.Email),
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Role, user.Role)
};
```

## Token signing and configuration
The project uses a symmetric signing key and HMAC-SHA256. The token includes issuer, audience, expiration and signing credentials.

JWT settings are read from the `Jwt` configuration section, including Key, Issuer, Audience and ExpiryMinutes. Signing keys must be kept secret and must not be committed to source control. Use User Secrets in development or a secure configuration provider in production.

## Testing
Use Postman to call the login endpoint with a registered user's credentials. Verify that valid credentials return a token, invalid credentials are rejected, and the response does not expose the stored password hash.

## V2 outcome
V2 adds credential verification and JWT generation. V3 configures the API to validate bearer tokens on incoming requests and protects selected endpoints.
